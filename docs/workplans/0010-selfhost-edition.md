# Workplan 0010 — Self-host edition: a runnable single-tenant bundle (NAS / mini-PC / Pi)

## Status — 2026-07-22 (update this block at the end of every session)

| Task | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| T1 startup migration runner (Postgres advisory lock) | ✅ Done | `packages/ledger/src/migrate.ts` — `runMigrations({connectionString})` enumerates `migrations/*.sql` (zero-padded → linear order), applies pending ones under advisory lock `727_0010`, records each in a `schema_migrations` table (one txn per migration), and **refuses to start** when the DB's highest applied version exceeds the highest the build ships (§22.1 downgrade guard). Idempotent re-run = no-op; runs as owner/superuser (0008/0009 create roles+RLS). Exported from `@openmig/ledger`. **Tests:** `migrate.integration.test.ts` (fresh→latest, re-run no-op, concurrent double-start applies once, newer-schema refusal) — each on a throwaway DB it creates/drops. **Gates:** lint + typecheck green (integration in CI). |
| T2 selfhost entrypoint app | ✅ Done (unit) | `apps/selfhost/src/index.ts` `start()`: applies T1 migrations → loads a **directory** of mapping JSONs (`loadConfigDir`, shared `parseMappingConfigJson`, fail-fast on invalid/duplicate) → schedules each with `InProcessScheduler` (croner + single-flight) → serves `GET /healthz` + `GET /status` (ledger-derived per-domain state, errors verbatim §11.2) → graceful shutdown (stop schedules, drain in-flight, close). **Shared, not forked:** `runAllDomains` extracted to `@openmig/worker/orchestration`; the real DAV connector factories (`dav-factories.ts`) are now used by **both** the file path (`build-deps.ts`) and the DB path (`build-deps-from-mapping.ts`), so self-host does **all four domains** for real. **Hard rule 5:** imports `@openmig/scheduler/in-process` (not the index, which re-exports the Trigger.dev client) — verified the whole selfhost graph has zero `@trigger.dev`/billing. **Tests:** `config-dir.unit.test.ts` + `status.unit.test.ts` run in a Docker-free selfhost vitest project (**7/7 green locally**). **Open:** integration start-against-Postgres + `SIGTERM` restart-resume is T5 (needs Docker). **Gates:** lint + typecheck green. |
| T3 all-in-one packaging (compose w/ bundled Postgres + multi-arch image) | ✅ Done | `deploy/selfhost/compose.yml` — **two services**: `postgres` (`postgres:18-alpine`, **local** `pgdata` volume, `pg_isready` healthcheck) + `app` (built from `apps/selfhost/Dockerfile`, `depends_on` postgres healthy, `restart: unless-stopped`, `/healthz` healthcheck, `./config`→`/data/config` ro + `appdata`→`/data/state`, `DATABASE_URL` at the bundled DB). `apps/selfhost/Dockerfile` — multi-stage Node 24-slim, corepack pnpm, non-root `appuser`, runs the T2 entrypoint under `tsx` (source-ships-TS), `HEALTHCHECK` on `/healthz`. **App self-migrates on startup** (T1) — no initdb mount needed. `deploy/selfhost/selfhost.env.example` (POSTGRES_* + `tokenFromEnv`/`passwordFromEnv` seam, `SELFHOST_BIND`/`SELFHOST_PORT`/`SELFHOST_IMAGE`), `deploy/selfhost/config/mapping.json.example` (valid mail mapping; `*.example` is not loaded), `deploy/selfhost/README.md` (quickstart + **stable/edge channel** convention §22.1). **Hard rule 5 guard:** `apps/selfhost/src/no-managed-leakage.unit.test.ts` walks the real transitive `@openmig` import graph from the entrypoint and fails on any `@trigger.dev`/billing/Mollie specifier (or the scheduler index) — **9/9 selfhost unit tests green**. **Verified on Docker host:** `docker compose build && up` on **arm64** (Spark) reaches healthy, demo `mapping.json` runs first shadow pass, `/status` reflects it. **Gates:** lint + typecheck green. |
| T4 secrets & config for self-host | ✅ Done | The `.env`-file pattern (`selfhost.env.example` + compose `env_file:`) documents the `tokenFromEnv`/`passwordFromEnv` seam and the bundled `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (compose refuses to start without it); file-permission (600), rotation, channels, and the ADR-0020 recovery story are in `deploy/selfhost/README.md` + `docs/selfhost-quickstart.md`. **Acceptance test:** `apps/selfhost/src/secret-hygiene.unit.test.ts` proves (1) `/status` is **allow-list based** — a status row smuggling a secret in a non-whitelisted field is fed to `buildStatusReport` and the serialized report is asserted **not** to contain it (and to expose only the six whitelisted domain keys); (2) `lastError` passes through verbatim (§11.2) carrying no credential; (3) the root `.dockerignore` excludes `**/.env` / `**/.env.*` (keeping filled-in secrets out of image layers) while allowing `*.example`. No secret is baked (creds arrive via env-file at run time) or logged (the entrypoint logs ids/counts/error messages, never config). **Gates:** lint + typecheck green; **12/12 selfhost unit tests green**. |
| T5 restart-resume idempotency gate (the acceptance centerpiece) | 🟡 E2E written; needs a **seeded** run to prove the property | `test/e2e/selfhost-restart-resume.e2e.test.ts` — black-box against a running compose stack: run a pass → `docker compose restart app` → run again → assert the **ledger item count did not grow** (zero duplicates). **Assertion corrected 2026-07-20:** the original read `domain.itemsCreated` (a field `/status` never emits) and shared state via `this` in arrow-fn `it()` callbacks (never carries) — it now compares the real `/status` `itemsSynced` (ledger-derived) across passes and tracks state at module scope. **Proven so far (arm64/Spark):** packaging self-migrates + schedules + `/status`, and the `migration_status.mapping_id`→`mailbox_mapping.id` FK path is correct. **Still open:** the idempotency assertion is only meaningful with a **seeded, non-zero source** — the first evidence run had an empty source (`pass complete (0 created)`), so zero-duplicates was not actually demonstrated; seed Stalwart with N>0 items and capture First N / restart / Second N (unchanged). Manual e2e (not automated CI). **2026-07-22 update:** an attempt to close this from inside a Docker-outside-of-Docker agent sandbox (mounted `docker.sock`, not the bare Spark runner `e2e.yml` itself uses) stalled for ~13 days across ~250 abandoned Testcontainers-volume attempts, then a second attempt surfaced a real, independent Stalwart-config bug on top of that. Both rounds root-caused and **fixed** — see `docs/stalwart-integration-fix.md` ("Running from inside a sandboxed agent container" + "Bugs found via Spark box forensics, and how they were actually fixed"). Summary: (1) `e2e.yml` assumed fixed host ports were free — fixed, ports now picked dynamically at runtime; (2) `deploy/compose/stalwart-config.json` turned out not to be a working-but-legacy config at all — it was **structurally invalid** (Stalwart's own parse error: `missing field @type at line 63`) and had probably never once started Stalwart successfully; (3) `apps/worker/src/build-deps.ts` hardcoded `tls: true` for the IMAP source connector regardless of configured port, a second independent bug that would have blocked the sync step even after (2) was fixed. **The actual fix**: retired `deploy/compose/Dockerfile.stalwart-config` + `stalwart-config.json` + `dev.yml`'s `stalwart` service + `deploy/selfhost/stalwart-compose.yml` entirely, in favor of one canonical `deploy/selfhost/setup-stalwart.sh` (the proven two-phase recovery→normal pattern, official image, joins `dev.yml`'s `openmig_dev-network` so the DooD network-join fix from (1)'s investigation keeps working); migrated the T5 fixture + seed step to IMAPS 993, matching the already-proven Testcontainers doctrine instead of a second, parallel one. **2026-07-22 round 3:** with Stalwart itself fixed, the next live run got further and hit two more real, pre-existing bugs (see `docs/stalwart-integration-fix.md` "Round 3"): `deploy/selfhost/compose.yml` alone can't reach a dev Stalwart on Linux (`host.docker.internal` needs an explicit `extra_hosts` entry there; the appliance's own compose network is separate from `openmig_dev-network`) — fixed via a new **dev/e2e-only** override, `deploy/selfhost/compose.dev.yml`, never used by real self-host operators; and `apps/worker/src/build-deps.ts` hardcoded IMAP source auth to XOAUTH2 regardless of `auth.kind`, silently dropping `login`-kind (password) credentials entirely — a genuine, previously-**untested** bug (now covered by `build-deps.unit.test.ts`), not a DooD artifact. **2026-07-22 round 4:** the first real `e2e.yml` dispatch on the bare Spark runner (no nested sandbox) failed at `setup-stalwart.sh` phase 1 with `Permission denied (os error 13)` reading `/etc/stalwart/config.json` — a plain perms mismatch (`mktemp` makes the config `0600` owned by the runner uid; Stalwart runs as a different uid in the container and can't read it), **not** the DooD "Is a directory" trap. Fixed by `chmod 644` on the secret-free config in `setup-stalwart.sh`. The next dispatch got one layer deeper — config readable, but the root-owned named volume wasn't writable by Stalwart's non-root user (`/opt/stalwart/data/LOG: Permission denied`); fixed by running both Stalwart phases `--user root`, mirroring `testcontainers-setup.ts`'s `.withUser('root')` (both in `docs/stalwart-integration-fix.md` "Round 4"). The next dispatch got Stalwart fully up (both phases) and reached the seed step, which then failed on Stalwart's self-signed IMAPS cert (`self-signed certificate`) — `test/e2e/seed-imap-source.mjs` didn't set `rejectUnauthorized: false`, unlike the app's own `ImapSource` connector; fixed. **Round 5 (the actual test ran):** the next dispatch seeded 15 messages ✓, built + started the appliance healthy ✓, and reached the gate — which failed with `no completed email pass with items — is the source seeded?`. Root cause: **workplan 0013 T7 changed the appliance to load mappings `paused`** and only schedule them after an explicit `POST /mappings/:id/start` green light; the T5 flow (test + workflow) predates that and never activated, so the mapping never scheduled and never synced (`/status` had no email domain → the test saw `null`). Fixed by adding a "Green-light the mapping" step to `e2e.yml` (POSTs `/start` after appliance startup, exercising the real activation endpoint) and updating the test's prerequisite comment. **Round 6 (activated + ran, but synced 0):** the next dispatch activated the mapping (`POST /start` → 303 ✓) and the appliance ran an email pass — which reached the gate's `itemsSynced` check with **0** (`expected 0 to be greater than 0`), despite 15 seeded messages. The appliance logs (the `[Worker] email sync complete: scanned=/created=/skipped=` line or a `lastError`) weren't captured because the test's `afterAll` ran `docker compose down` and removed the container first. Fixed: removed that `afterAll` teardown (the test is black-box and never owned the stack — the workflow's Cleanup step does), and added an `always()` **diagnostics step** to `e2e.yml` dumping `/status` + appliance + Stalwart logs. Also corrected the stale "Empty Folder List" note in `stalwart-integration-fix.md` — `jmap-reindex.integration.test.ts` proves real IMAP→JMAP message sync works in CI, so `itemsSynced=0` is a real failure to diagnose, not expected. **Round 7 (diagnosed the 0):** the diagnostics step showed the email domain `state: failed`, `lastError: "Not connected to JMAP server"` — the JMAP **target** never established a session, so the pass failed before touching the source. Root cause: the fixture's `target.baseUrl` was `http://…:18080/.well-known/jmap`, but `JmapTargetWriter` **appends** `/.well-known/jmap` (session) + `/jmap` (API) to `baseUrl`, so it doubled to `…/.well-known/jmap/.well-known/jmap` and the session load failed. The working `jmap-reindex.integration.test.ts` passes the **origin** (`http://host:port`). Fixed: fixture + the `e2e.yml` mapping rewrite now use the origin (`http://stalwart:8080`). Also made the diagnostics uploadable as an artifact (the old `**/reports/` glob matched nothing). **Still open:** the First N / restart / Second N evidence — with the target now able to connect, the next dispatch should actually sync the 15 seeded messages (First N=15), restart, and resync unchanged. |
| T6 quickstart + backup/upgrade docs | ✅ Done | `docs/selfhost-quickstart.md` — NAS / mini-PC / Pi (arm64) / Windows-WSL2 walkthrough from `mapping.json` → first shadow pass → reading `/status`; **backup** (`pg_dump` before every upgrade, §22.1), **upgrade path** (pull → `up -d` → migrations auto-apply under the lock; never two versions on one DB; the downgrade guard), the **ADR-0020** recovery story (ledger loss ≠ data loss — reindex rebuilds from the target), the **ADR-0023** footprint trade-off (bundled Postgres vs the old embedded-SQLite idea), and the local-volume-only DB warning. Linked from the README; the stale "not yet runnable" status line is refreshed. **Gates:** docs-hygiene green. |

## Why this slice
"Self-host must keep working" is a hard rule, but today the self-host edition **does not exist as
a runnable thing**: `apps/selfhost/src/index.ts` is a one-line placeholder
(`export const app = '@openmig/selfhost';`), migrations don't run on startup, and there is no
packaging a NAS/Pi owner could actually deploy. Everything proven so far runs through dev-stack
scripts and the worker CLI. The migration *core* is done (0001/0002/0007) and the worker already
orchestrates all domains — this slice packages that into a single-tenant appliance.

## Definition of Done (the gate)
On a clean machine (amd64 **and** arm64): `docker compose -f deploy/selfhost/compose.yml up -d`
brings up a **bundled Postgres + one app container** that (a) applies ledger migrations on startup
under an advisory lock against a mounted `/data` Postgres volume, (b) schedules the configured
mappings with the in-process croner scheduler, (c) serves a local status endpoint, and (d) after
`docker restart` **resumes incrementally from cursors with zero duplicates** — the idempotency
property test run as a black box against the running stack. `pnpm` gates green; the
kill-and-restart test (T5) is the acceptance centerpiece (§5: "intermittently-on host resumes
cleanly").

## In scope
- A startup **migration runner** (Postgres advisory lock; refuses to start when the DB schema is
  newer than the app understands — §22.1), used by selfhost and reusable by the worker.
- A real `apps/selfhost` entrypoint composing existing pieces: config load → migrations →
  `InProcessScheduler` → the worker's multi-domain sync → status endpoint.
- Docker packaging: a small **bundled Postgres** service + one app image, multi-arch
  (amd64+arm64), pinned digests, `stable` tag convention (§22.1); align with the existing CI
  security-scan (signing/SBOM), don't duplicate.
- Self-host secrets: env-file based, documented; no vault dependency.
- The restart-resume black-box idempotency gate.

## Out of scope (later)
- Home Assistant add-on and the hybrid agent (§7.1) — after the compose path is proven.
- Tauri tray app / Windows-native (§25.3, ADR-0019) — container-first stands.
- Embedded/serverless Postgres (pglite/embedded-postgres) to drop the container — ADR-0023 parks
  this as the future "no container" path; **not** this slice.
- Web UI inside the bundle beyond a status endpoint — the managed web app (0011) is separate; the
  entrypoint must leave an obvious mount point for a future local UI.
- Multi-tenancy / RLS anything (that's managed, 0011). Self-host is single-tenant: isolation is
  trivial, RLS is not required (ADR-0023).

## Tasks

### T1 — Startup migration runner (Postgres advisory lock)
A small runner in `packages/ledger` (used by selfhost + reusable by worker/managed): enumerate
`migrations/*.sql`, apply linearly under a **Postgres advisory lock**, record applied versions in
a `schema_migrations` table, and **refuse to start** if the DB reports a version newer than the
binary supports (§22.1). Idempotent re-run is a no-op; skipping versions (N-2 → N) works by linear
application. (Single dialect now — no SQLite branch.)
**Acceptance:** §22.1 CI gates as integration tests (Testcontainers Postgres) — fresh-install
empty→latest, re-run no-op, **concurrent double-start applies once** (two processes race the lock,
one wins), newer-schema refusal path. Note migrations `0008/0009` create roles/RLS — the runner
must apply them as a superuser/owner while the *app* connects as a less-privileged role.

### T2 — Selfhost entrypoint app
Replace the placeholder: `apps/selfhost/src/index.ts` loads config (a directory of mapping JSONs
under `/data/config/`, same `parseMappingConfig` schema), runs T1 migrations, registers every
mapping with `InProcessScheduler` (croner + single-flight, already built), runs the worker's
existing multi-domain orchestration (`runAllDomains` pattern from `apps/worker/src/index.ts` —
extract/share it, don't fork it), and exposes `GET /status` + `GET /healthz` on localhost
(per-mapping/per-domain: last run, counts, errors, sync freshness — from `MigrationStatusStore`,
which already exists). Graceful shutdown finishes the in-flight folder and persists cursors.
**Acceptance:** unit tests for config-dir loading + status shape; integration: start against the
bundled Postgres + Stalwart, two scheduled passes occur idempotently, `SIGTERM` mid-pass →
restart → no duplicates, cursor advanced.

### T3 — All-in-one packaging (bundled Postgres)
`deploy/selfhost/`: `compose.yml` with **two services** — `postgres` (small, `POSTGRES_*` from
env-file, `/data/pgdata` volume, healthcheck) and `app` (the selfhost image, `depends_on` postgres
healthy, restart policy, healthcheck on `/healthz`, `/data/config` + `/data` mounted). App
`DATABASE_URL` points at the bundled Postgres. Dockerfile: multi-stage, Node 24-slim, non-root
user. CI job builds **amd64+arm64** via buildx (Spark runner verifies native arm64). Base images
digest-pinned; document `stable`/`edge` channels (§22.1) even if only `edge` publishes for now.
**Acceptance:** compose up on x64 CI and on the Spark (arm64) both reach healthy; app waits for
Postgres and self-migrates; a demo `mapping.json` runs a first shadow pass; `/status` reflects it.

### T4 — Secrets & config for self-host
`.env`-file pattern (compose `env_file:`) for the token/password env names the mapping schema
already references (`tokenFromEnv`/`passwordFromEnv` — the seam exists) plus the bundled
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. Document file permissions (600), rotation, and the ADR-0020 recovery story
(ledger loss ≠ data loss: reindex rebuilds from the target). Optional age-encryption (§7.3)
documented as a pattern, not a dependency.
**Acceptance:** bundle runs with secrets supplied only via env-file; no secret appears in image
layers, logs, or `/status` output (asserted in a test).

### T5 — Restart-resume idempotency gate (acceptance centerpiece)
A black-box integration/e2e test against the running compose stack: seed a source (Stalwart),
run one pass, `docker restart` the app mid/after a pass, run again → **zero duplicates, cursor
advanced, target state identical** (§5 "intermittently-on host resumes cleanly"). Wire it into the
e2e workflow against the built image.
**Acceptance:** the restart-resume test is green in the e2e workflow; evidence (counts First N /
restart / Second 0) pasted into this Status block.

### T6 — Quickstart + backup/upgrade docs
`docs/selfhost-quickstart.md`: NAS/Pi/Windows-WSL2 walkthrough (ADR-0019: container-first; Windows
via Docker Desktop/WSL2 works today) — from `mapping.json` to first shadow pass to reading
`/status`. Backup guidance per §22.1 (**back up the `/data` Postgres volume before upgrade**; use
`pg_dump` for a portable dump; never run two app versions against one DB) and the upgrade path
(pull new tag → restart → migrations auto-run under the lock). Note the ADR-0023 footprint
trade-off (a Postgres container vs the old embedded-SQLite idea) so self-hosters know why.
**Acceptance:** a fresh reader executes the quickstart on one target platform end-to-end;
docs-hygiene green; README links it.

## Conventions & gotchas
- **No managed leakage:** anything Trigger.dev/vault/IdP/billing-shaped in this path violates hard
  rule 5 — keep a compile-time check that `apps/selfhost` imports no `@trigger.dev/*` and no
  billing modules. (RLS is not needed here — single tenant.)
- **Postgres on NAS:** the `/data/pgdata` volume must be a **local** volume; document that network
  filesystems (SMB/NFS) are unsupported for the DB (corruption risk).
- **Migrator vs app roles:** the migration runner (T1) applies `CREATE ROLE`/RLS migrations as
  owner; for self-host the app can connect as owner too (single tenant, RLS unused) — but keep the
  runner/app connection seam so the managed edition (0011) can use a restricted `app_user`.
- Keep the image lean (no imapsync/vdirsyncer/rclone binaries by default — JS-native paths from
  0002/0007 are the default engines per ADR-0019; shell-out engines are opt-in docs).
- New tests follow the `*.unit.test.ts` / `*.integration.test.ts` naming; Stalwart rules per
  `docs/stalwart-integration-fix.md`.
